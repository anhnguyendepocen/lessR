fix(mydata)

### transforming values of data
*** create a new variable called Weight.root. square root of existing values of Weight ***
mydata <- Transform(Weight.root=sqrt(Weight))

***if data values for a categorical vaiable are coded with integers, consider
converting to the R data type for categorical data, a factor, using factor function***

mydata <-Transform(Gender=factor(Gender,
          levels=c(0,1), labels=c("Male", "Female")))

### levels
***refers to the integer values of the variables as to read into R.  Lables argument refers to their value lables***

*** if levels of categorical variable are to be presented in an order out of alphabetical,
use factor function to inform R of the correct order, either with ordered or unordered levels ***
mydata <- Transform(Satisfaction=factor(Satisfaction,
            levels=c("low", "med", "high"), ordered=TRUE))
            
### recoding scoring items
*** sometimes survey items are written so that agreeing is actually disagree***
mydata <- Recode(m03, old=0:5, new=5:0)

### sorting
mydata <- Sort(c(Gender, Salary), direction=c("+", "-"))
*** sorting data first by Gender, then by Salary. Gender ascending, Salary descending ***

### subset 
mydata <- Subset(Gender=="M" & Years<10, columns=c(Years, Salary)
  *** this data retains only men who have worked in a company for less than 10 yrs, and
      retain two variables, the number of years worked and salary ***
      
  *** opposite of Subset is Merge (merge dataframes).  combines two different data frames into one *** 
      ***horizontal merge  row.names***
          mydata <- Merge(dataH1, dataH2, by="row.names")
      *** vertical merge, when both data frames contain the same variable***
            mydata <- Merge(dataV1, dataV2)

### new variable from arithmetic 
*** define a new variable which looks at the number of months employeed at a company ***
mydata <- Transform(Months=Years*12)
    *** new variable is months ***

### scale function
*** standardize the values of a variable ***

### converting an integer variable to a factor
*** add value labels to a numerically coded categorical variable ***
mydata <- Transform(
Gender=factor(Gender, levels=c(0,1), labels=c("Male", "Female"))
)

### converting nominal data to ordinal data / ordered function
mydata <- Transform(Satisfaction=factor(Satisfaction, 
          levels=c("low", "med", "high"), ordered=TRUE))

### Likert Data
*** save Likert response category names into an object (here, LikertCats) ***
LikertCats <-c("Strongly Disagree", "Disagree", "Slightly Disagree", 
                "Slightly Agree", "Agree", "Strongly Agree")

*** use the above to apply factor trasnformation ***
mydata <- Transform (
m06.f = factor(m06, levels=0:5, labels=LikertCats),
m07.f = factor(m07, levels=0:5, labels=LikertCats),
m09.f = factor(m09, levels=0:5, labels=LikertCats),
m10.f = factor(m10, levels=0:5, labels=LikertCats)
)
