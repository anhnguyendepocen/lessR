mydata <- Read()

SPSS .sav
R .rda

### for data files that exist on the web
mydata <- Read("http://lessRstats.com/data/employee.csv")

### identify a column of the data file that has unique row IDs with the row.names
option, such as the following if the IDs are in the first column

mydata <- Read(row.names=1)

### for missing values already coded -99 etc
mydata <- Read(missing=c(-99, "XX"))

### if the data uses comma instead of decimal, Read2 to read a csv file
mydata <- Read2()

### read variable labels, such as from a separate text file, to add data to provide more info. output
than what is provided by shorter variable names

mydata <- Read(labels="myLabels.csv")

### write the data file in native R format to save all info regarding data such as any variable lables, which 
can be quickly read back into R at later time

Write("MyBestData", format="R")

### factor
R data storage for categorical variables

### read data and assign first column as row IDs
mydata <- Read(row.names=1)

### n.cat option
***the max. num of unique values to consider a numeric variable as categorical***
set(n.cat=4)

### no text output
mydata <- Read(quiet=TRUE)

### read tab delimited data
mydata <- Read(sep="\t")

### read data with commas for the decimal separator
mydata <- Read(sep=";", dec=",") or mydata <- Read2()

### tell R to display a decimal separator as a comma
options(OutDec=",")

?options

### skip specified number of lines (comments)
mydata <- Read(skip=6)

### fix width data
fwd
***all data values for a variable occur in specified columns***

  ### rep function
    *** create a string of characters by repeating a specified set of characters ***
    rep(1,20)
      ***will process 20 1's as if they were entered manually***
  
  ### function to
    ***will read a set of variables with prefixed character string***
    to("m",20)
      ***out put will be "m01" "m02" etc

  ### col.names
    specify variable names
  
  ***read fwd with numbered variable names***
    mydata <- Read(widths=c(4,1,rep(1,20)),
    col.names=c("ID", "Gender", to("m",20)))
  
### reading data internally from lessR
mydata <- Read("Employee", format="lessR")

***variable labels a description (usually longer) of a variable's meaning***

### Excel
read.xlsx

### read data and variable labels from the same file 
mydata <- Read(labels="row2)

### standard R functions
hist(mydata$m06, xlab=label(m06)

### write data in native R format
Write("MyGoodData", format="R") or wrt.r("MyGoodData")

***R writes the data in current working direction, move later to where you want***
